Table ​​1-2c. Sex of graduate students, postdoctoral appointees, and doctorate-holding nonfaculty researchers in engineering: 1977–2022

I chose this data to analyze because it is something personal and is very important to me. Coming from a long line of strong women who were not able to go to college, let alone grad school, i aim to keep track of the progression we are making as a society in educating women. Seeing how low the number of women enrolled in graduate school in 1977 compared to now is very different, in a good way because its higher now. But it is still nowhere near the amount of men who are enrolled in graduate school. We need to continue to monitor how big the gap is and figure out how to shrink the gap between women and men being enrolled in grad school. i have two daughters and i hope that when theyre in college they'll look at these numbers and wonder how they were ever so low.
